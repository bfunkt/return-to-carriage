------------------


Add some more realism to combat / health

    - combat can damage different parts of your body in different ways. 
    - some kinds of damage can slow you down, weaken you, decrease abilities, etc.
    - some kinds of damage require time and rest to heal. 
        - After a bad injury, it may be necessary to exit the dungeon and seek aid. Hopefully you don't bleed out before you get out.
        - Would be cool if critical injuries lead to unconsciousness, but you are more likely to remain conscious as long as danger is nearby
          (example: you lose consciousness a few paces after exiting the dungeon; wake up later in the healer's hut)
    - need water / food / sleep
    - poisons can differ in strength and effect
    - would be nice if healers can give you advice about causes / treatments for your ailments.
    - detailed blow-by-blow logging of activities that lead to health problems so we can learn from our mistakes
    - head wounds can cause amnesia (forget parts of levels, skills, scroll effects, etc)
    
    
-------------------

More realism to skills / memory
    - You can forget parts of the maze that you haven't visited recently or frequently
    - Unused skills degrade over time (but with a realistic memory model)
    - Spells / potions can improve your memory
    - Magic maps


-------------------


Characters die permanently, but dungeons are persistent. 
    - It is possible to leave resources behind for the next adventurer (maps, gold, treasure..)
    - It is possible to encounter the remains of dead adventurers, but there's a good chance their corpse has already been looted.
        (and you might find their stuff in the posession of nearby monsters)
    - You can spin up a new dungeon, but transferring a character to another dungeon incurs a skill / gold penalty (as if you spent a lot of time and money traveling to the next dungeon)
    
 
--------------------

Inventory management
    - Avoid creating the temptation to mine / sell all items in the dungeon
    - Resale value is very low
    - Most corpses can be looted, but it's unlikely you'll find anything valuable. (crappy weapons, armor that doesn't fit, etc)
    - Realistic inventory - carry as many rings / scrolls as you like, but a spare suit of armor will encumber you.
    - Should be easy to drop pack for combat
    - weapons / armor have realistic degradation (don't get iron wet, on't throw spears at the wall, etc)



--------------------


Detail and perception
    - Lots of detail available if you examine everything
    - Caracters with higher perception will notice more detail, even without manually looking
    - features in the environment have both visibility (how likely you are to notice) and salience (how likely you are to care). 
        whether a feature shows up in the event log depends on (visibility * perception) * salience
    

---------------------

Portals
    - Advanced characters will have rare opportunities to open rifts / portals between levels to avoid long trips in/out of the dungeon
    - Be creative with graphics for these
        - Shift part of the map to open cracks
        - Dynamically open wormhole as you approach the portal
        - Remote end of the portal is visible through the portal 
        
        
---------------------

Terrain

    - Many types of terrain -- dungeons, caves, forest, water, etc
    - would be cool to have large ground level + multiple entrances to underground
    
    
---------------------


Gameplay

    - mixed realtime and turn-based play
    - for multiplayer, turn-based play operates locally
    - most parts gamepad playable
    - Use mouse / js for ranged weapon aiming
        skill affects accuracy
    - combination of rougelike and interactive fiction
        one panel gives a description of the local area
            descriptions can be hierarchical -- terse descriptions can be expanded 
        one panel gives description of character state
        console for entering commands + event log
        
----------------------


Graphics

    Primarily text on a grid, especially early in the game
    Dynamic lighting (torches flicker, fireballs cast moving shadows, etc)
    particles for magic effects / explosions
    Depth? 
        ground level terrain can be 3D
        some parts of levels can be transparent to level below
    Parts of the map that are out of line-of-sight (by that you still remember) are desaturated / dimmed
